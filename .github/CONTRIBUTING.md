# How to contribute

Contributions to CharlieSpring are highly encouraged and desired. Below are some guidelines that will help make the process as smooth as possible.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Submit a new issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Suggesting Enhancements

- When submitting an issue for an enhancement, please be as clear as possible about why you think the enhancement is needed and what the benefit of
    it would be.

## Making Changes

- From your fork of the repository, create a topic branch where work on your change will take place.
- To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
- Please follow the prevailing code conventions in the repository. Differences in style make the code harder to understand for everyone.
- Make sure you have added all the necessary unit tests for your changes.
- Run _all_ unit tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.
  - The first line of the commit message should be a short description around 50 characters in length and be prefixed with the GitHub issue it refers to with parentheses surrounding that. If the GitHub issue is #25, you should have `(#25)` prefixed to the message.
  - If the commit is about documentation, the message should be prefixed with `(doc)`.
  - If it is a trivial commit or one of formatting/spaces fixes, it should be prefixed with `(maint)`.
  - After the subject, skip one line and fill out a body if the subject line is not informative enough.
  - Sometimes you will find that even a tiny code change has a commit body that needs to be very detailed and make take more time to do than the actual change itself!
  - The body:
    - Should wrap at `72` characters.
    - Explains more fully the reason(s) for the change and contrasts with previous behavior.
    - Uses present tense. "Fix" versus "Fixed".

A good example of a commit message is as follows:

```text
(#123) Add more cowbell to Get-Something

The functionality of Get-Something would be greatly improved if there was a little
more 'pizzazz' added to it. I propose a cowbell. Adding more cowbell has been
shown in studies to both increase one's mojo, and cement one's status
as a rock legend.
```

## Documentation

We are infallible and as such the documentation needs no correction. In the highly
unlikely event that that is _not_ the case, commits to update or add documentation
are highly appreciated.

## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository.
- Once the pull request has been reviewed and accepted, it will be merged with the master branch.
- Celebrate
